RPN Complex Software Calculator
==============================================================================

* Synopsis
	  This is a software calculator created for practice of VB.NET and object-
	oriented programming.  You need the .NET Framework 2.0 runtime in order to
	run this software.
	  This software, unlike ordinary calculators, implements the reverse
	Polish notation for input.  For example, you must input "1 Enter 2 +"
	instead of "1 + 2 =" for the sum of one and two (just like the word order
	of Japanese language, namely "1 ni 2 o tasu").  Up to four values, namely
	X, Y, Z and T, can be stacked.
	  This software is capable of calculations of complex number.


* Installation
	  Extract the archive into a folder you would like.


* Uninstallation
	  Delete the folder you have installed this software.


* How to use
	  You may use your keyboard instead of the on-screen buttons.
	
	0-9 (0-9 on keypad):
		  Inputs the corresponding number.

	. (Decimal key on keypad):
		  Inputs decimal point.

	Enter (Enter key):
		  Pushes the value you were being inputting onto the stack.

	C (Esc key):
		  Resets the stack.

	CE (Delete key):
		  Resets the value of X on the stack.

	Del (Backspace key):
		  Deletes the last digit of the value you are inputting.

	+ (+ key on keypad):
		  Pops two values from the stack, then pushes the value of Y + X.

	- (- key on keypad):
		  Pops two values from the stack, then pushes the value of Y - X.

	× (* key on keypad):
		  Pops two values from the stack, then pushes the value of Y × X.

	÷ (/ key on keypad):
		  Pops two values from the stack, then pushes the value of Y / X.

	+/- (F9 key):
		  Inverts the sign of the value you are inputting (i.e. where the
		value blinks).

	X↔Y (Insert key):
		  Swaps X and Y of the stack.

	R↓ (PageDown key):
		  Rotates the stack.  Value of Y moves into X, and Z into new Y, and
		so on.

	(Tab key):
		  There are no buttons corresponding this key on the window.  This
		moves the cursor (i.e. where the value blinks) right by 1 area.

	Re/Im (I key):
		  Moves the cursor between the real and the imaginary parts (modulus
		and argument when the Polar switch (described below) is on).

	Ma/Ex (E key):
		  Moves the cursor between mantissa and exponent.

	π (P key):
		  Pushes the value of pi onto the stack.

	LastX (X key):
		  Pushes the value you have input the last time onto the stack.

	ln or eˣ (N key):
		  When Inv switch (described below) is turned off, pops X, then pushes
		the natural logarithm of X onto the stack.
		  Otherwise, pops X, then pushes the Xth power of e onto the stack.

	log₁₀ or 10ˣ (L key):
		  When Inv switch is turned off, pops X, then pushes the common
		logarithm of X onto the stack.
		  Otherwise, pops X, then pushes the Xth power of ten onto the stack.

	x² (Q key):
		  Pops X, then pushes X squared onto the stack.

	√x (R key):
		  Pops X, then pushes the square root of X onto the stack.

	yˣ (W key):
		  Pops two values from the stack, then pushes the Xth power of Y onto
		the stack.

	1/x (K key):
		  Pops X, then pushes the reciprocal of X onto the stack.

	sin, Arcsin, sinh, Arsinh (S key):
		  When Inv switch is turned off, pops X, then pushes the sine of X
		onto the stack.
		  When Inv switch is turned on, pops X, then pushes the principal
		value of the arcsine of X onto the stack.
		  Angles are input or output by radians normally, but by degrees when
		Deg switch (described below) is turned on.
		  When Hyp switch (described below) is turned on, hyperbolic sine and
		area hyperbolic sine are used instead of (trigonometric) sine and
		arcsine respectively.

	cos, Arccos, cosh, Arcosh (C key):
		  When Inv switch is turned off, pops X, then pushes the cosine of X
		onto the stack.
		  When Inv switch is turned on, pops X, then pushes the principal
		value of the arccosine of X onto the stack.
		  Angles are input or output by radians normally, but by degrees when
		Deg switch is turned on.
		  When Hyp switch is turned on, hyperbolic cosine and area hyperbolic
		cosine are used instead of (trigonometric) cosine and arccosine
		respectively.

	tan, Arctan, tanh, Artanh (T key):
		  When Inv switch is turned off, pops X, then pushes the tangent of X
		onto the stack.
		  When Inv switch is turned on, pops X, then pushes the principal
		value of the arctangent of X onto the stack.
		  Angles are input or output by radians normally, but by degrees when
		Deg switch is turned on.
		  When Hyp switch is turned on, hyperbolic tangent and area hyperbolic
		tangent are used instead of (trigonometric) tangent and arctangent
		respectively.

	x! (G key):
		  Pops X from the stack, then pushes the factorial of X onto the
		stack.  Strictly speaking, this calculates Γ(X+1).

	|x| (M key):
		  Pops X from the stack, then pushes the modulus of X onto the stack.

	Arg (A key):
		  Pops X from the stack, then pushes the argument of X onto the stack.
		This will return by radians, regardless of the Deg switch.

	x̅ (J key; you will see an x with a bar above when correctly rendered):
		  Pops X from the stack, then pushes the argument of X onto the stack.
		This will return by radians, regardless of the Deg switch.

	Deg (D key):
		  Switches the unit for angles.  When turned on, uses degrees; other-
		wise, uses radians.

	Polar (O key):
		  Switches the expression for complex numbers.  When turned on, uses
		the polar form (r∠θ); otherwise, uses the algebraic form (a+bi).

	Inv (V key):
		  When turned on, uses the inverse functions.  This affects ln, log₁₀,
		sin, cos and tan.

	Hyp (H key):
		  When turned on, uses the hyperbolic functions instead of trigono-
		metric ones.  This affects sin, cos and tan.

	Float (F key):
		  When turned on, avoids the scientific notation when possible (as in
		100.25 or 1234).
		  When turned off, always uses the scientific notation (as in 1.0025
		×10² or 1.234×10³).

	Power (Alt+F4):
		  Exits from this software.


* Configuration
	  Once you have run this software, the window position, Deg and Float
	switch status are automatically saved to Config.xml.
	  ButtonFont, ButtonFontAdjust, DisplayFont and DisplayFontAdjust speci-
	fies the fonts to be used on the application.  These properties cannot be
	changed on the running software, but you may need to change these values
	especially when you are running on Windows XP (not Vista or 7 which in-
	cludes Calibri and Consolas fonts).  ButtonFont and DisplayFont specify
	the font names.  ButtonFontAdjust and DisplayFontAdjust specifies the
	scale factor of the font size.  If you use DejaVu Sans and Sans Mono, we
	recommend 0.8x as font size scale.
